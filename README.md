## Projects
### Alien Game
This link directs you to my GitHub repository. It shows a group project I did with my peers that involved creating an alien game using Python. It was challenging, fun, and retro, giving an old school vibe! If you can, run the program and play!

### Film Edit
I shared a clip about one of my favorite time traveling films. I'm not yet fluent in Spanish, so it was challenging to write and discuss the movie. I went viral after a long hiatus from media. It felt good to connect with film again!

### Music Edit
In this section you will see a video edit I did for my friend’s band. It didn’t get many views, but I didn’t care and was so proud of him and myself for bringing it to life!
